/**
 * ProgramOne - Exercise 5.35 (Computer-Assisted Instruction): The use of computers in education is referred to as computer ¬assisted instruction (CAI). Write a program that will help an elementary school student learn multiplication. Use a Random object to produce 2 positive 1-digit integers. The program will then prompt the user with a question, such as “How much is 6 times 7?”

The student then inputs the answer. Next, the program checks the student’s answer. If it is correct, display the message “Very Good!” and ask another multiple question. If the answer is wrong, display the message “No. Please try again.” And let the student try the same question repeatedly until the student finally gets it right. A separate method will be used to generate each new question. This method will be called once when the application begins execution and each time the user answers the question correctly.
